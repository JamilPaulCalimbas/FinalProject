        <p class="section-description">
          The heart and soul of our restaurant is the story of Merlina and Teofilo Calimbas. Their culinary journey, rooted in family and tradition, continues to guide us.</p>
           
          <p>The Calimbas family's connection to traditional Filipino cuisine, specifically kakanin (native delicacies), dates all the way back to the 1970s. This early experience, spent mastering precise techniques and traditional recipes passed down through generations, instilled in them a deep respect for authentic Filipino flavors and quality ingredients—the bedrock of their future business.</p>

          <p> Drawing on decades of experience and a shared passion for exquisite dining, Merlina and Teofilo realized their lifelong dream by founding this restaurant in 2015. The establishment is the culmination of their hard work, their love for Filipino culture, and their desire to share those unforgettable, home-cooked flavors with the community.</p>

         <p>In 2025, the family suffered a profound loss with the passing of co-founder, Teofilo Calimbas. Today, the restaurant is lovingly led by Merlina, who continues to uphold the high standards and authentic vision she shared with Teofilo. Every dish served is a tribute to his legacy and the enduring partnership they built together. We invite you to experience the passion that Teofilo and Merlina poured into every corner of this culinary haven.</p>
